### Best Practices to Avoid Breaking the Project and Debugging Hell

Developing MeetSolis—a complex Next.js app with integrations like Supabase, Clerk, WebRTC, and payments (Paddle/Razorpay)—requires discipline to maintain stability. Below, I outline proven best practices tailored to your solo development setup with Claude and Cursor AI. These focus on prevention, incremental progress, and efficient debugging, drawing from standard software engineering principles (e.g., agile, CI/CD basics) to minimize downtime and frustration.

### 1. **Version Control and Branching Strategy**

- **Commit Often and Meaningfully**: Commit every 15-30 minutes or after completing a small task (e.g., "Add Clerk auth to dashboard"). Use descriptive messages like "feat: implement file upload UI with Shadcn Dropzone" (follow Conventional Commits for clarity).
- **Branch per Feature**: Never work on main. Create feature branches (e.g., git checkout -b feat/authentication-setup). Merge via pull requests (even solo—use GitHub PRs for self-review).
- **Backup Regularly**: Push to GitHub after each session. Enable GitHub Actions for basic CI (e.g., linting on push) to catch issues early.
- **Why This Helps**: Prevents "breaking" the project by isolating changes. If a feature fails, revert with git revert or switch branches without affecting the stable main.

### 2. **Incremental Development and Testing**

- **Build in Small Steps**: Follow the to-do list phases strictly—complete and test one task before moving on (e.g., set up Clerk auth fully before dashboard UI). Use "atomic" changes: Implement, test, commit.
- **Test Early and Often**:
    - **Unit Tests**: Use Jest for components/API routes (e.g., test ChatWindow.tsx renders messages).
    - **Integration Tests**: Test Clerk + Supabase sync with mock data.
    - **End-to-End Tests**: Use Playwright/Cypress for flows like "sign up → create meeting → send message".
    - Run tests before commits: Add a script like npm test in your workflow.
- **Mock Dependencies**: During frontend dev, mock Supabase/WebRTC with static JSON or libraries like MSW (Mock Service Worker) to avoid real DB calls breaking things.
- **Why This Helps**: Catches bugs early, reducing "debugging hell" where one change cascades into multiple failures. Aim for 80% test coverage on critical paths (auth, video calls).

### 3. **Environment and Dependency Management**

- **Use .env Files Properly**: Store all keys (Clerk, Supabase, Paddle) in .env.local (gitignored). Use dotenv if needed, and validate env vars on app start (e.g., with zod for schema validation).
- **Lock Dependencies**: After installing (e.g., npm install @clerk/nextjs), run npm install to update package-lock.json. Avoid npm update mid-project—pin versions to prevent breaking changes.
- **Consistent Dev Setup**: Use Node.js LTS (v20+), and document your setup in README.md (e.g., "Run with Node 20.10"). Use Docker for local Supabase if needed for reproducibility.
- **Why This Helps**: Prevents "it works on my machine" issues. If a dependency update breaks something, rollback with npm ci.

### 4. **Code Quality and Linting**

- **Enforce Standards**: Run ESLint/Prettier on save (VS Code extensions) and via Husky pre-commit hooks. Fix all warnings before committing.
- **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript strictly—define interfaces for all props/states (e.g., MeetingProps in types/meeting.ts). Avoid any types.
- **Code Reviews**: Even solo, use Cursor AI or Claude to review code snippets (e.g., "Review this API route for security issues").
- **Why This Helps**: Reduces runtime errors (e.g., undefined vars) that lead to debugging nightmares. Clean code is easier to debug.

### 5. **Debugging Strategies to Avoid Hell**

- **Log Strategically**: Use console.log sparingly—opt for structured logging with pino or Sentry for production-like errors. Log key events (e.g., "WebRTC connection established").
- **Step-by-Step Debugging**: Use VS Code debugger for Next.js (set breakpoints in API routes/components). For browser issues, use React DevTools and Network tab.
- **Isolate Issues**: When something breaks, bisect with Git (git bisect) to find the bad commit. Reproduce in a minimal sandbox (e.g., create a temp component to test WebRTC alone).
- **Error Handling**: Wrap async code in try/catch, use React Error Boundaries for UI crashes. Display user-friendly errors with React-Toastify.
- **Monitor in Dev**: Use PostHog/Sentry early to track errors (e.g., unhandled promises). Set up Vercel previews for each branch to test deployments.
- **Why This Helps**: Turns "hell" into systematic fixes. Aim to spend <20% time debugging by preventing issues upfront.

### 6. **Deployment and Monitoring**

- **Deploy Early**: Push to Vercel after each phase—test in a real env to catch Vercel-specific issues (e.g., serverless timeouts).
- **Rollback Plan**: Tag stable releases (e.g., git tag v0.1-auth-done). If production breaks, redeploy from a tag.
- **Security Scans**: Run npm audit weekly; use Snyk for vuln checks.
- **Why This Helps**: Ensures the project stays deployable, avoiding last-minute breaks.

### 7. **Personal Workflow Tips**

- **Daily Routine**: Start with a 10-min review of yesterday's commits. End with a working state (no half-baked code).
- **Time Management**: Use Pomodoro (25-min focus) for tasks; break if stuck >15 mins—consult docs or AI.
- **Documentation**: Update README.md and inline comments as you go. Track decisions in a Notion/Todoist log.
- **Hardware/Setup**: Use a reliable machine; backup code weekly to external drive.

Following these, your project should progress smoothly—estimate 4-6 weeks for MVP without major halts.

### Tips for Using Claude Code and Cursor AI

Claude (from Anthropic) and Cursor AI (AI-powered code editor) are excellent for your project, especially for generating code with your tech stack. Claude excels at reasoning and code explanation, while Cursor integrates AI directly into editing (e.g., autocompletions, chat). Below are tips, including using documentations, agents, and MCP servers (Model Context Protocol servers—an open standard for connecting AI to external tools/data, like filesystem access or web scraping, to enhance capabilities).

### General Tips

- **Start Small**: Feed Claude/Cursor small prompts (e.g., "Generate a Next.js API route for Supabase user sync with Clerk"). Iterate: Generate → Review → Test → Refine.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Be specific—include context like "Use TypeScript, Shadcn UI, and Tailwind. Follow best practices for security." Reference your to-do list: "Implement Phase 2: Authentication Setup."
- **Error Handling**: If code fails, paste errors into Claude/Cursor: "Debug this: [error message]. Suggest fixes."
- **Integration**: Use Claude in browser/app for planning; Cursor for editing (it supports Claude models via API keys).

### Using Documentations

- **Incorporate Docs in Prompts**: Always reference official docs to ground AI outputs. E.g., "Using Next.js 14 docs on App Router, generate a protected route with Clerk." Copy-paste relevant doc sections into prompts for accuracy.
- **Claude**: Use for doc summarization: "Summarize Supabase RLS from their docs: [paste link or text]. Apply to users table."
- **Cursor AI**: In chat mode, ask "Explain Vercel env vars from docs"—it pulls context from your codebase/docs. Enable "Doc Search" in settings for auto-referencing.
- **Tip**: Bookmark key docs (Next.js, Supabase, Clerk, Paddle, Razorpay). Use MCP servers (below) for real-time doc access if needed.

### Using Agents

- **Claude Agents**: Claude's "agents" are prompt-based workflows for tasks (e.g., "Act as a debugging agent: Step-by-step analyze this WebRTC error"). Use for multi-step reasoning: "As a security agent, audit this API route for vulns."
- **Cursor AI Agents**: Switch to "Agent Mode" (Cmd+K) for autonomous tasks. E.g., "Agent: Implement file upload with Supabase Storage, test it." It uses your codebase context and can call MCP servers (below) for advanced actions.
- **Tip**: Combine: Use Claude to plan agent prompts, then execute in Cursor. For complex features (e.g., AI summaries), prompt: "Agent: Integrate OpenAI API, anonymize data per privacy best practices."

### Using MCP Servers

MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers extend Claude/Cursor by connecting to external tools/data (e.g., local files, browsers). They're Node.js services you install/run locally or via marketplaces. From my knowledge (up to 2025), they're impactful for your project—e.g., filesystem MCP for code access, sequential-thinking for step-by-step debugging.

- **Setup in Claude**: Install Claude CLI (npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code). Add MCP servers via claude mcp add [server-name] or edit ~/.claude.json directly for flexibility (e.g., add "sequential-thinking" for chain-of-thought reasoning).
- **Setup in Cursor**: Edit .cursor/mcp.json in your project root. Add servers like: { "mcpServers": { "filesystem": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem"] } } }. Refresh in Cursor settings (Settings > MCP > Refresh).
- **Recommended MCP Servers for Your Project**:
    - **Sequential-Thinking**: For step-by-step code generation/debugging (e.g., "Think sequentially to implement WebRTC"). Install: claude mcp add sequential-thinking -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking.
    - **Filesystem**: Gives AI access to your local files (e.g., read docs/code for context). Useful for "Analyze my Supabase schema file."
    - **Browser Tools (Playwright/Puppeteer)**: For testing UI (e.g., automate video call tests). Install: claude mcp add playwright -- npx -y @playwright/mcp-server.
    - **Fetch**: For HTTP requests (e.g., test APIs). Install: claude mcp add fetch -- npx -y @kazuph/mcp-fetch.
    - **Custom**: Build your own for project-specific needs (e.g., Supabase query MCP).
- **Tips for MCP**:
    - **Security**: Run locally; authorize tool calls manually in Cursor/Claude to avoid unauthorized access.
    - **Usage**: In prompts, say "Use filesystem MCP to read my types/meeting.ts and suggest improvements." Cursor agents auto-detect MCP tools.
    - **Impact**: Reduces debugging by letting AI access real data (e.g., "Use sequential-thinking MCP to debug this error step-by-step"). Start with 1-2 servers to avoid overload.
    - **Troubleshooting**: If issues, restart apps. Use MCP marketplaces (e.g., Cursor Directory, Claude MCP Community) for pre-built ones.

### Other Features

- **Projects in Claude**: Organize prompts into projects (e.g., "FreelancerVC Auth Project") for reusable context.
- **Cursor Composer**: For multi-file edits—prompt "Composer: Refactor dashboard with Shadcn UI across files."
- **Version Control Integration**: In Cursor, use Git features with AI: "Explain this diff" or "Generate commit message."
- **Limitations**: AI can hallucinate—always test generated code. Use for 80% boilerplate, manual for core logic (e.g., WebRTC security).

Leverage these for faster iteration—e.g., generate 70% of code with AI, focus on testing/integration. If stuck, prompt: "Best practice for [issue] in Next.js." Let me know if you need prompts/code for specific tasks!
