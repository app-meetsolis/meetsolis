# Product Requirements Document: MeetSolis (Revised)

## 1. Product Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

MeetSolis  is a video conferencing tool designed for freelancers and small to mid-size service agencies, focusing on 1:1 or small-group client calls (e.g., pitches, reviews). It solves inefficiencies in existing platforms (e.g., Zoom’s bloat, Meet’s lack of niche features) by offering a minimalist, freelancer-first solution with integrated collaboration, billing, and productivity tools.

## 5A. User Experience

### 5.1 User Flow

1. **Onboarding**: Sign up via email; connect Calendly/Upwork for scheduling/verification; 1-min tutorial.

The flow is divided into phases: **Discovery & Empathy**, **Personalization & Empowerment**, **Guided Exploration**, **Quick Value Delivery**, and **Ongoing Support**. Each step includes detailed screen descriptions, user interactions, UI elements, transitions, and rationale for customer focus.

### Phase 1: Discovery & Empathy (Sign-Up & Welcome – 1-2 minutes)

This phase starts by validating the user's pain points, making them feel seen as busy freelancers juggling clients, rather than jumping into product features.

1. **Initial Sign-Up Screen**
    - **Visuals**: Full-screen hero image of a relaxed freelancer (diverse representation: e.g., a female designer in a home office) mid-call with a client, overlaid with soft gradients in teal and navy (brand colors). Subtle animation: A faint "waveform" pulse simulating smooth audio.
    - **Content**: Headline: "Welcome to FreelancerVC – Your Client Calls, Reimagined for You." Subtext: "We know freelancing means unpredictable schedules, endless Zoom fatigue, and chasing scopes. Let's make your calls feel effortless and professional."
    - **Interactions**: Quick sign-up options: Google/Apple/Email (with auto-fill suggestions). No password required initially—use magic link for premium, frictionless feel. If email, a conversational prompt: "What's your name and freelance niche? (e.g., Graphic Designer)" – this seeds personalization.
    - **Customer Focus**: Asks about their role first (e.g., dropdown: Designer, Marketer, Consultant, Other) to tailor the journey. If "Other," a free-text field with AI suggestions based on input. Rationale: Builds empathy by recognizing their identity, not assuming everyone is the same.
    - **Transition**: Smooth fade to welcome screen with a personalized greeting animation (e.g., "Hey Alex, Graphic Designer Extraordinaire!").
2. **Empathy Validation Screen**
    - **Visuals**: Interactive carousel of relatable scenarios (e.g., illustrated cards: "Client calls running overtime?" "Struggling with note-taking mid-convo?" "Burnout from back-to-back meetings?"). Each card has a subtle hover glow and tap-to-flip animation revealing a teaser solution (e.g., "Our timers keep things on track").
    - **Content**: "Tell us what frustrates you most about client calls." Multi-select checkboxes with options like "Technical glitches," "Scope creep," "Fatigue," "Language barriers," plus an "Other" text field.
    - **Interactions**: Users select 2-3 pain points; AI analyzes for later personalization (e.g., if "Fatigue," prioritize fatigue alerts in tour). Submit button: "Let's Fix That Together."
    - **Customer Focus**: This step mirrors therapy-like validation, focusing on their daily struggles to foster trust. Data collected informs a customized dashboard later.
    - **Transition**: Animated progress bar fills 20%; confetti-like particles celebrate submission, leading to personalization.

### Phase 2: Personalization & Empowerment (Profile & Setup – 1-2 minutes)

Here, we empower users by letting them shape the platform around their workflow, emphasizing how it adapts to them, not vice versa.

1. **Profile Customization Screen**
    - **Visuals**: Clean, card-based layout with premium avatars (AI-generated options based on niche, e.g., artistic for designers). Background: Subtle video loop of calm ocean waves for a burnout-free vibe.
    - **Content**: "Make FreelancerVC Yours. Set up your profile to impress clients from the start." Fields: Upload photo/logo, bio (pre-filled suggestion: "Hi, I'm [Name], a [Niche] helping businesses thrive."), preferred language (for AI translation).
    - **Interactions**: Drag-and-drop for photo; AI-powered bio enhancer button ("Polish My Bio") that suggests premium phrasing based on niche. Toggle for "Client-Facing Mode" (hides personal details).
    - **Customer Focus**: Focuses on how this boosts their professional image—e.g., tooltip: "Clients see a polished you, building trust instantly." If they selected "Scope creep" earlier, prompt to add default agenda templates. Rationale: Freelancers value branding; this makes them feel in control.
    - **Transition**: Slide animation to next screen, with a voiceover option (opt-in): "Great setup, [Name]! Now, let's align with your day."
2. **Workflow Personalization Screen**
    - **Visuals**: Interactive quiz-like interface with animated sliders and checkboxes. Premium icons (e.g., gold-trimmed timers).
    - **Content**: "How do you freelance? We'll tailor features to your style." Questions: "Average call length?" (slider: 15-120 mins), "Frequent tools?" (select: Whiteboard, File Sharing, Timers), "Client types?" (e.g., International for translation priority).
    - **Interactions**: Branching logic—e.g., if long calls, suggest fatigue alerts; if international, auto-enable translation. End with a "Personalized Recommendations" summary card (e.g., "Based on your marketing niche, try our slide-integrated whiteboard for pitches.").
    - **Customer Focus**: Centers on their routine, using responses to create a "Your Custom Dashboard" preview. Rationale: Avoids overwhelming with all features; shows value immediately through relevance.
    - **Transition**: Progress bar to 50%; seamless load to exploration with a motivational message: "You're set up for success!"

### Phase 3: Guided Exploration (Interactive Tour – 1 minute)

An interactive, skippable tour that highlights benefits through user-driven scenarios, keeping the spotlight on client interaction wins.

1. **Interactive Tour Screen**
    - **Visuals**: Modal overlay with AR-like elements—e.g., a simulated call interface with hotspots. Modern animations: Pulse effects on clickable areas, fluid transitions between steps.
    - **Content**: "Experience Your First Call – Guided Walkthrough." Steps framed as benefits: "Stay on Track with Custom Timers" (not just "Timers feature").
    - **Interactions**: 4-5 micro-tutorials:
        - Tap to "start a mock call" – HD video demo with low-latency toggle.
        - Drag a file into chat for sharing simulation.
        - AI agenda generator: Input "Client pitch" and watch auto-summary create it.
        - Fatigue alert demo: Slider to simulate long call, triggering a gentle notification.
        Skip button always visible; progress saved if exited.
    - **Customer Focus**: Each step ties back to their pain points (e.g., "Remember your scope creep frustration? Here's how AI tracks it in real-time."). Ends with: "How does this fit your workflow?" (thumbs up/down for feedback). Rationale: Interactive to engage, but customer-led to avoid feeling like a sales pitch.
    - **Transition**: Fade out modal; progress bar to 75%.

### Phase 4: Quick Value Delivery (First Action & Integration – 1 minute)

Deliver immediate wins to hook users, focusing on productivity gains for their next client interaction.

1. **First Action Prompt Screen**
    - **Visuals**: Dashboard preview with personalized elements (e.g., their bio, recommended tools pinned). Premium confetti animation on completion.
    - **Content**: "Ready for Your First Win? Schedule a test call or share an async video." Options: "Start Mock Call," "Create Agenda Template," "Invite a Colleague."
    - **Interactions**: One-click actions—e.g., "Mock Call" launches a solo room with teleprompter pre-loaded with their bio. If integrations needed (e.g., calendar sync), a seamless OAuth flow for Google Calendar.
    - **Customer Focus**: Emphasizes quick ROI: "In under a minute, prep for your next client and feel the difference." Tracks completion for a "Achievement Unlocked" badge (e.g., "Burnout Buster"). Rationale: Freelancers need fast value; this builds momentum.
    - **Transition**: Direct to dashboard; progress bar completes.

### Phase 5: Ongoing Support (Feedback & Retention – 30 seconds)

Wrap up with support that feels like a partner, encouraging long-term engagement.

1. **Feedback & Next Steps Screen**
    - **Visuals**: Warm, illustrated thank-you card with their name. Subtle email opt-in animation.
    - **Content**: "Thanks for joining, [Name]! How was your onboarding?" (Star rating + open text). "Next: Explore unlimited calls for $12-15/month – start your trial?" Followed by tailored tips: "Based on your niche, check out whiteboard for designs."
    - **Interactions**: Submit feedback; AI responds in-app (e.g., "Noted your fatigue concern – we've prioritized alerts for you."). Links to community forum or 1-click support chat.
    - **Customer Focus**: Positions the platform as an ally: "We're here to evolve with your freelancing journey." Sends a personalized welcome email recapping their setup. Rationale: Builds loyalty by listening, focusing on their growth.
    - **End of Flow**: Redirect to fully personalized dashboard, with a non-intrusive tooltip: "Need help? Your concierge AI is ready."

**Overall Rationale & Best Practices**: This journey is 80% customer-focused (pain validation, personalization, benefits over features) and 20% product-oriented, ensuring users feel empowered and valued. Metrics for success: High completion rates via gamification (progress bar, badges), low drop-off with skippable elements, and post-onboarding surveys. Accessibility: Voiceover for all screens, high-contrast mode. Premium touches like custom illustrations and AI personalization create an exclusive feel, differentiating from generic tools like Zoom. If iterated, A/B test pain point selections for even deeper empathy.

1. **Pre-Call**: Set buffer timer; AI generates agenda; quality check; teleprompter upload option.
2. **In-Call**: HD video with whiteboard, chat, file sharing, timer, scope alerts, clarifier/translation.
3. **Post-Call**: AI summary/todos emailed; threads persist; async video option; wellness dashboard updates.

### 5.2 UI/UX Principles

- **Minimalist**: Clean dashboard; no upsell clutter (unlike Zoom).
- **Intuitive**: Drag-drop file sharing, one-click whiteboard, auto-save settings.
- **Professional**: Virtual backgrounds, audio-first options, teleprompter for polished delivery.

We lean into a minimalist color scheme (white, deep black navy) for a sophisticated, distraction-free experience, with optional dark mode for extended use. All elements are designed for responsiveness across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile), ensuring seamless transitions. Accessibility is baked in, following WCAG 2.1 guidelines.

## 1. Overall Design Philosophy

- **Minimalism First**: Every screen should have ample white space (or navy in dark mode) to reduce visual clutter, inspired by ChatGPT's sparse chat view. Avoid decorative elements; focus on functional beauty—e.g., use subtle gradients only for depth in key areas like call backgrounds.
- **User-Centric Premium Feel**: Interfaces adapt to the user's niche (e.g., designers get more whiteboard prominence), echoing Notion's customizable blocks. Premium cues include high-fidelity icons (vector-based, anti-aliased) and soft haptic feedback on mobile for actions like starting a call.
- **Consistency and Predictability**: Uniform patterns across the app—e.g., all buttons are rounded (8px radius) with navy outlines. Inspired by Slack, use contextual tooltips that appear on hover/tap, explaining features in plain language (e.g., "AI Summary: Auto-captures key points to save you time").
- **Performance-Oriented**: Low-latency interactions (under 100ms response times) mirror Zoom's real-time feel. Load states use elegant skeletons (navy placeholders) rather than spinners.
- **Emotional Resonance**: Design evokes calm and control—e.g., fatigue alerts as gentle, non-intrusive nudges with a soft navy banner, helping users avoid burnout without judgment.

## 2. Color Palette

A restrained, minimalist scheme inspired by Notion's neutral tones and ChatGPT's high-contrast simplicity, with deep navy as the anchor for a premium, nautical vibe (evoking reliability and depth).

- **Primary**: Deep Navy (#001F3F) – For headers, active states, and accents. Used sparingly for focus (e.g., call buttons).
- **Secondary/Background**: Pure White (#FFFFFF) – Default canvas for light mode, promoting openness.
- **Neutrals**:
    - Light Gray (#F0F0F0) for backgrounds/subtle dividers.
    - Mid Gray (#A0A0A0) for secondary text/icons.
    - Dark Gray (#333333) for body text in light mode.
- **Accents**: Soft Teal (#00A0B0) – For success states, links, and interactive elements (e.g., "Join Call" button). Inspired by Zoom's blue hues for video controls.
- **Alerts/Errors**: Muted Red (#FF4D4F) for errors, Soft Yellow (#FFD700) for warnings (e.g., fatigue alerts)—used minimally to avoid alarm.
- **Dark Mode**: Invert for premium night use (inspired by Slack/ChatGPT):
    - Background: Deep Navy (#001F3F).
    - Text: White (#FFFFFF).
    - Accents: Light Teal (#66D9E8) for visibility.
    - Auto-detect based on device settings, with manual toggle in settings.

No more than 5-6 colors per screen to maintain minimalism. Use 60-30-10 rule: 60% white/navy background, 30% neutrals, 10% accents.

## 3. Typography

Clean, sans-serif fonts for readability and modernity, drawing from Notion's versatile text system and ChatGPT's straightforward messaging.

- **Font Family**: System defaults for performance (e.g., -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI") or Inter (open-source, similar to Slack's). Fallback to Helvetica.
- **Hierarchy**:
    - Headings: Bold, 24-32px (e.g., "Upcoming Calls" in navy).
    - Body Text: Regular, 14-16px, line-height 1.5 for scannability.
    - Subtext/Captions: 12px, mid-gray for timestamps or tooltips.
    - Buttons/Labels: Medium weight, 14px, uppercase for CTAs (e.g., "START CALL").
- **Principles**: High contrast (4.5:1 ratio minimum). Kerning adjusted for premium feel. In video calls, overlay text (e.g., participant names) uses semi-transparent navy backgrounds for legibility, like Zoom's gallery labels.
- **AI-Generated Text**: For summaries/agendas, use italicized styling in teal to differentiate from user input, enhancing the conversational feel like ChatGPT.

## 4. Layout and Grid System

Modular and flexible, inspired by Notion's block-based structure for easy customization.

- **Grid**: 12-column responsive grid (e.g., using CSS Grid). Desktop: 1200px max-width centered. Mobile: Stack vertically with 16px gutters.
- **Key Layouts**:
    - **Dashboard**: Sidebar navigation (left, like Slack) for quick access to Calls, Agendas, Files. Main area: Card-based feed (e.g., upcoming calls as navy-bordered cards with subtle shadows—elevation 1dp for premium depth).
    - **Video Call Screen**: Full-screen immersion like Zoom—bottom toolbar for controls (mute, share, whiteboard) with icons only (tooltips on hover). Gallery view: Adaptive grid (1-4 participants large, 5+ thumbnails). Right sidebar for chat/file sharing, collapsible to minimize distraction.
    - **Whiteboard/Slides**: Floating modal or split-screen, drag-and-drop integration. Inspired by Notion, allow pinning elements (e.g., timers as overlays).
    - **Async Video/Teleprompter**: Chat-like interface (like ChatGPT) with timeline scrubber for editing.
- **White Space**: Generous padding (24px standard) to breathe, reducing fatigue. Use flexbox for dynamic resizing.

## 5. Navigation

Intuitive and contextual, minimizing clicks like Slack's channels.

- **Global Nav**: Top bar with logo (minimalist "FVC" icon in navy), search (for calls/agendas), profile avatar (dropdown for settings/dark mode).
- **Sidebar**: Persistent on desktop—sections like "My Calls," "Tools" (whiteboard, AI features), "Integrations." Collapses to hamburger on mobile.
- **In-Call Nav**: Bottom dock with large, touch-friendly icons (e.g., mic, camera, end call in teal). Swipe gestures for mobile (e.g., swipe up for chat).
- **Breadcrumbs/Contextual**: For deep flows (e.g., editing agendas), subtle navy links like "Dashboard > Call #123 > Agenda."
- **Principles**: Keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Ctrl+K for search, like Notion) for power users. Smooth transitions (300ms ease-in-out) between screens.

## 6. Interactions and Animations

Subtle and purposeful, enhancing premium feel without gimmicks, inspired by ChatGPT's fluid typing animations.

- **Buttons/Inputs**: Rounded (8px), with hover states (scale 1.05, navy to teal transition). Loading: Pulse animation in gray.
- **Animations**: Micro-interactions only—e.g., fade-in for new messages (like Slack), slide-up for notifications. Fatigue alerts: Gentle expand from top with a soft vibration.
- **Gestures**: Drag-and-drop for files/slides (haptic feedback). Pinch-to-zoom on whiteboard.
- **Feedback**: Immediate visual cues—e.g., checkmark icon in teal for successful file share. Error states: Inline messages in muted red, auto-dismiss after 5s.
- **AI Interactions**: Conversational inputs (e.g., type "Summarize last call" in a search bar), with auto-complete suggestions like ChatGPT.

## 7. Feature-Specific UI

Tailored to enhance freelancer productivity, keeping interfaces minimalist.

- **HD Video/Low-Latency**: Auto-optimize toggle in settings; in-call indicator (small navy badge: "Low Latency Active").
- **Timers/Scopes**: Floating navy timer widget, draggable. AI scope tracking: Sidebar list with checkboxes, auto-updated in real-time.
- **Messaging/File Sharing**: Inline chat like Slack—emoji reactions, threaded replies. Files as cards with previews.
- **AI Features (Summaries, Translation)**: Post-call dashboard card: "AI Summary" expandable accordion. Translation: Real-time subtitles below video feeds, toggleable.
- **Teleprompter/Todo/Fatigue**: Teleprompter as overlay text scroller (speed adjustable slider). Todo: Minimalist list in sidebar, drag to reorder. Fatigue: Non-modal banner with "Take a Break?" button.
- **Async Video**: Recording interface like Zoom's self-view, with edit timeline (navy scrubber).

## 8. Accessibility

- **Contrast/Readability**: All text meets AA standards; enlargeable fonts.
- **Keyboard/Nav**: Full tab navigation; ARIA labels for screen readers (e.g., "Mute button").
- **Color-Blind Friendly**: Patterns over color (e.g., icons with shapes for alerts).
- **Inclusive**: Diverse avatars/icons; alt text for all visuals.

## 9. Responsiveness and Device Adaptation

- **Breakpoints**: Desktop (>1024px): Full features. Tablet (768-1024px): Collapsed sidebars. Mobile (<768px): Stacked layouts, larger touch targets (48px min).
- **Principles**: Progressive enhancement—core features (calls, chat) work offline via PWA. Test on real devices for premium smoothness.

## 10. Iteration and Testing Guidelines

For V1, prioritize A/B testing on key flows (e.g., call start time). Gather user feedback via in-app surveys. Future versions can add more customizations, but maintain minimalism as the core.

This V1 set creates a cohesive, premium experience that feels like an extension of the freelancer's mind—simple, powerful, and burnout-proof. If you'd like wireframes or refinements, let me know!

### Basic In-Meeting Controls

| Competitor Feature/Button | Relevance to Niche | Recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mute / Unmute audio | Essential for quick adjustments during client pitches to avoid distractions. | Enhance: Already implied in HD video; add prominent toggle button with AI noise suppression (via WebRTC) for pro audio. |
| Start / Stop Video | Core for professional appearances in 1:1 calls. | Enhance: Integrate with auto-optimize mode; add one-click audio-first toggle for low-pressure intros. |
| Select audio source / camera source via drop-downs / settings (test speaker/microphone) | Helps freelancers test setup pre-call to reduce glitches (60% pain point). | Add: Pre-call quality check screen with dropdowns and quick test button; use JS for simulation. |
| Share Screen (desktop / window / application / specific content) | Useful for demos, but freelancers prefer integrated tools. | Enhance: Build on whiteboard/file sharing; add window-specific share with annotation overlay. |
| Stop Sharing Screen | Quick exit from shares to refocus on discussion. | Add: Dedicated red "Stop Share" button in toolbar; auto-pause timer during shares. |

| Record meeting (local / cloud, depending on plan) | Freelancers need records for follow-ups, but cloud is key for mobility. | Enhance: Already in auto-recording; add local fallback option for offline users. |
| Switch between speaker view / gallery view | Better for 1:1 focus vs. small-group dynamics. | Add: Toggle button for speaker/gallery; default to speaker for pitches, gallery for reviews. |

- **Retention**: <10% monthly churn (vs. 5-10% micro SaaS average); 80% user satisfaction.
- **Revenue**: $3,000-$5,000 MRR with single plan; 250 users at $12 or 200 at $15.
- **Usage**: 60% use whiteboard/chat; 40% enable AI summaries/todos; 50% adopt timers; 20% use translation.

## 7. Roadmap

### 7.1 Phase 1: MVP (6-8 Weeks)

- Core features: All 16 features (video, whiteboard, timers, messaging, file sharing, recording/summaries, agenda, scheduling, optimize mode, badges, scope tracker, teleprompter, todos, translator, fatigue dashboard, async video).
- Launch: Beta on Product Hunt/Reddit r/freelance; pre-sell $12-15/month.
- Cost: $600-1,200 dev; $185/month running.

### 7.2 Phase 2: Optimization (3 Months Post-Launch)

- Refine AI accuracy (e.g., summaries, todos) based on user feedback.
- Add integrations (e.g., Stripe for payments, Trello for todos).
- Test pricing ($12 vs. $15) for optimal MRR.

### 7.3 Phase 3: Scale (6-12 Months)

- Expand to adjacent niches (e.g., consultants, educators) if MRR stalls.
- Optimize costs (e.g., bulk AI credits) if user base exceeds 1,000.
- Explore white-label for agencies.

## 8. Risks and Mitigations

- **Competition**: Free tiers (Zoom, Meet) dominate. **Mitigation**: Highlight all-in-one features; leverage X/Reddit complaints for marketing.
- **Technical Stability**: Video lag risks churn. **Mitigation**: Test WebRTC rigorously; fallback to Agora/Twilio (~$50/month).
- **Acquisition Costs**: Slow organic growth. **Mitigation**: Partner with X influencers ($50-200/post); free beta for buzz.
- **API Dependency**: OpenAI/DeepL price hikes. **Mitigation**: Cap AI usage; fallback to Deepgram for transcription (~$10/month).
- **Churn**: Users revert to free tools. **Mitigation**: Sticky features (e.g., timers, todos); AI support bot for onboarding.

## 9. Validation Plan

- **Pre-Launch**: Create landing page (Carrd, ~$19/year); post on r/freelance for feedback; pre-sell 50 users at $12-15/month.
- **Beta Launch**: Free tier (limited features) on Product Hunt; collect 100 beta users; iterate based on feedback.
- **Post-Launch**: Monitor PostHog for usage/churn; adjust UI/AI based on reviews; target LinkedIn/Upwork groups for growth.
