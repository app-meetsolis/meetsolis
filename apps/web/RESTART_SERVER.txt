CRITICAL: SERVER RESTART REQUIRED
================================================================================

The API route GET /api/meetings is returning 404 because the server hasn't
been restarted after critical changes.

STEPS TO FIX:
-------------

1. In your terminal where "npm run dev" is running:
   Press Ctrl+C to STOP the server

2. Wait for the process to fully stop (prompt returns)

3. Run this command:
   npm run dev

4. Wait for this message:
   ✓ Ready in X seconds
   ✓ Compiled successfully

5. Refresh your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R for hard refresh)

6. Check DevTools Console - the 404 error should be GONE

WHAT THIS FIXES:
-----------------
✓ Picks up new environment variable: NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL
✓ Rebuilds routing table with API routes
✓ Clears corrupted cache
✓ Re-compiles all pages and API endpoints

TIME TO FIX: ~2 minutes (rebuild time)
