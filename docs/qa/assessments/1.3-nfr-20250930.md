5. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**
   - ‚úÖ Comprehensive CSP headers
   - ‚úÖ Web Workers allowed: `worker-src 'self' blob:`
   - ‚úÖ Clerk domains whitelisted: `*.clerk.dev`, `*.clerk.accounts.dev`
   - ‚úÖ Cloudflare CAPTCHA whitelisted: `https://challenges.cloudflare.com`
   - ‚úÖ No `'unsafe-inline'` or `'unsafe-eval'` in production

6. **Rate Limiting**
   - ‚úÖ Inherited from Story 1.2
   - ‚úÖ Preserved in middleware integration
