# Final Assessment
final_assessment: |
  This story represents an OUTSTANDING foundation setup that exceeds typical requirements.
  The sophisticated WebRTC testing framework, comprehensive service architecture, and
  production-ready build pipeline demonstrate exceptional technical execution.

  All critical blocking issues have been systematically resolved with precise fixes.
  The implementation is now ready for production deployment with enterprise-grade
  quality standards met across all dimensions: security, performance, reliability,
  and maintainability.

  Recommendation: APPROVE for Done status - this foundation provides an excellent
  starting point for the MeetSolis video conferencing platform development.
