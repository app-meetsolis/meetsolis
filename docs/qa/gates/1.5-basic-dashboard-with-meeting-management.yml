nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Authentication via Clerk properly implemented, RLS policies enforced, input validation with Zod, rate limiting configured (conditional). Good security posture."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "React Query caching (30s staleTime), Realtime subscriptions properly managed, skeleton loaders for perceived performance. Metrics are mock data pending Epic 4."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages, Realtime reconnection logic, ErrorBoundary implemented, toast notifications for feedback."
  maintainability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Good service layer separation and React Query patterns, but coding standards violations (env access, code duplication, any types) reduce maintainability."
