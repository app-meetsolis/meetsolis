**Main Story Sequence (from PRD):**
- 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, **1.6**, 1.7, 1.8 ‚Üí Epic 2

**Technical Debt / Sub-stories:**
- Use decimal notation: 1.6.1, 1.6.2, etc.

## Notes

**Story 1.6 vs Story 1.6.1 Conflict Resolution:**
- Original issue: Quinn's QA review created "Story 1.6" for tech debt
- Resolution: Renamed to Story 1.6.1 to align with PRD sequence
- PRD Story 1.6 (Analytics) takes precedence as main story
- Tech debt becomes sub-story for tracking purposes

**Epic 1 Completion Criteria:**
- All stories 1.1-1.8 complete
- All critical tech debt resolved
- No blocker bugs or security issues
- Analytics and monitoring operational
- Landing page live and SEO optimized

**Epic 2 Prerequisites:**
- Story 1.6 (Analytics) must be complete for video call tracking
- Story 1.7 (Landing Page) should be complete for user acquisition
- Story 1.8 (Onboarding) recommended but not blocking
