**so that** development can proceed smoothly without external service blocking issues.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All external service accounts created and API keys generated
2. Service connectivity validated in development environment
3. Mock service layer implemented for offline development
4. Service abstraction interfaces defined for graceful degradation
5. Circuit breaker patterns implemented for external service calls
6. Environment configuration supports both real and mock services
7. Service health check dashboard created for monitoring
8. Rollback procedures documented for service failures

### Risk Mitigation Focus

### Service Abstraction Pattern
[Source: Risk Mitigation Strategy]
```typescript
interface ExternalService {
  isAvailable(): Promise<boolean>;
  fallbackMode(): boolean;
  healthCheck(): Promise<ServiceStatus>;
  getServiceInfo(): ServiceInfo;
}

interface ServiceStatus {
  status: 'healthy' | 'degraded' | 'unavailable';
  responseTime: number;
  lastCheck: Date;
  errorCount: number;
}
```

### Circuit Breaker Implementation
```typescript
class CircuitBreaker {
  private failureCount = 0;
  private lastFailureTime?: Date;
  private state: 'closed' | 'open' | 'half-open' = 'closed';

  async execute<T>(operation: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T> {
    if (this.state === 'open') {
      if (this.shouldAttemptReset()) {
        this.state = 'half-open';
      } else {
        throw new Error('Circuit breaker is open');
      }
    }

    try {
      const result = await operation();
      this.onSuccess();
      return result;
    } catch (error) {
      this.onFailure();
      throw error;
    }
  }
}
```

### Service Factory Pattern
```typescript
class ServiceFactory {
  static createAuthService(): AuthService {
    return process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' && process.env.USE_MOCK_SERVICES
      ? new MockAuthService()
      : new ClerkAuthService();
  }

  static createDatabaseService(): DatabaseService {
    return process.env.USE_MOCK_SERVICES
      ? new MockDatabaseService()
      : new SupabaseService();
  }
}
```

### Fallback Strategies by Service
[Source: Risk Mitigation Strategy]
- **Clerk**: Local auth fallback for development
- **Supabase**: In-memory database with local PostgreSQL instructions
- **OpenAI**: Template-based summaries with keyword extraction
- **DeepL**: Passthrough mode (no translation)
- **Twilio**: Console logging for SMS notifications
- **PostHog**: Console logging for analytics events
- **Sentry**: Console error logging

### Environment Variables Required
```bash
# Real Services
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=
OPENAI_API_KEY=
DEEPL_API_KEY=
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_API_KEY=

# Service Configuration
USE_MOCK_SERVICES=true  # Development override
SERVICE_TIMEOUT_MS=5000
CIRCUIT_BREAKER_THRESHOLD=5
RETRY_ATTEMPTS=3
```

### Testing

[Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Test File Locations:**
- Service abstraction tests: `apps/web/tests/lib/services/`
- API route tests: `apps/web/tests/api/health/`
- Component tests: `apps/web/tests/components/admin/`
- Integration tests: `apps/web/tests/integration/services/`

**Test Standards:**
- Frontend: Jest + React Testing Library for component/hook tests
- Backend: Jest for API route and utility function tests
- Integration: Jest for service connectivity tests
- E2E: Cypress for service health dashboard workflows

**Testing Frameworks and Patterns:**
- Use `@testing-library/react` for component testing
- Use `node-mocks-http` for API route testing
- Mock external services using Jest mocks during unit tests
- Use real service connections for integration tests with test accounts
- Test circuit breaker state transitions with controlled failures

**Specific Testing Requirements:**
- Unit tests for each service abstraction interface
- Integration tests for real service connectivity validation
- Mock service behavior validation tests
- Circuit breaker functionality and state transition testing
- Fallback scenario testing with network failures
- Service health check endpoint testing
- Environment configuration switching tests (mock vs real services)
- Service factory pattern tests for correct service instantiation
