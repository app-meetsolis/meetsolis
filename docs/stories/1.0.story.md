### Risk Mitigation Focus

### Service Abstraction Pattern
[Source: Risk Mitigation Strategy]
```typescript
interface ExternalService {
  isAvailable(): Promise<boolean>;
  fallbackMode(): boolean;
  healthCheck(): Promise<ServiceStatus>;
  getServiceInfo(): ServiceInfo;
}

interface ServiceStatus {
  status: 'healthy' | 'degraded' | 'unavailable';
  responseTime: number;
  lastCheck: Date;
  errorCount: number;
}
```

### Circuit Breaker Implementation
```typescript
class CircuitBreaker {
  private failureCount = 0;
  private lastFailureTime?: Date;
  private state: 'closed' | 'open' | 'half-open' = 'closed';

  async execute<T>(operation: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T> {
    if (this.state === 'open') {
      if (this.shouldAttemptReset()) {
        this.state = 'half-open';
      } else {
        throw new Error('Circuit breaker is open');
      }
    }

    try {
      const result = await operation();
      this.onSuccess();
      return result;
    } catch (error) {
      this.onFailure();
      throw error;
    }
  }
}
```

### Service Factory Pattern
```typescript
class ServiceFactory {
  static createAuthService(): AuthService {
    return process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' && process.env.USE_MOCK_SERVICES
      ? new MockAuthService()
      : new ClerkAuthService();
  }

  static createDatabaseService(): DatabaseService {
    return process.env.USE_MOCK_SERVICES
      ? new MockDatabaseService()
      : new SupabaseService();
  }
}
```

### Fallback Strategies by Service
[Source: Risk Mitigation Strategy]
- **Clerk**: Local auth fallback for development
- **Supabase**: In-memory database with local PostgreSQL instructions
- **OpenAI**: Template-based summaries with keyword extraction
- **DeepL**: Passthrough mode (no translation)
- **Twilio**: Console logging for SMS notifications
- **PostHog**: Console logging for analytics events
- **Sentry**: Console error logging

### Environment Variables Required
```bash
# Real Services
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=
OPENAI_API_KEY=
DEEPL_API_KEY=
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_API_KEY=

# Service Configuration
USE_MOCK_SERVICES=true  # Development override
SERVICE_TIMEOUT_MS=5000
CIRCUIT_BREAKER_THRESHOLD=5
RETRY_ATTEMPTS=3
```
