## Dev Notes

### Risk Mitigation Focus
This story specifically addresses **First-Time User Onboarding (Low Risk)** identified in the PO Master Checklist validation.

**Reference:** `docs/prd.md#risk-mitigation-strategy`

### Testing Strategy

#### Unit Tests (Jest + React Testing Library)
**Location:** `apps/web/src/components/onboarding/__tests__/`

**Key Test Suites:**
1. **OnboardingState Management** (`onboarding-state.test.ts`)
   - Test state transitions between steps
   - Verify progress calculation logic
   - Test skip functionality for optional steps
   - Validate completion persistence

2. **Device Testing Components** (`device-wizard.test.tsx`)
   - Mock `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()`
   - Test permission request flow
   - Verify error handling for denied permissions
   - Test device quality detection logic

3. **Browser Compatibility Detection** (`browser-compat.test.ts`)
   - Test feature detection for various browsers
   - Verify upgrade guidance generation
   - Test graceful degradation logic

#### Integration Tests
**Location:** `apps/web/tests/integration/onboarding/`

**Key Scenarios:**
1. Complete onboarding flow with all steps
2. Onboarding with skipped optional steps
3. Device permission error recovery flow
4. Browser incompatibility detection and guidance
5. Analytics event tracking validation

#### E2E Tests (Playwright)
**Location:** `tests/e2e/onboarding/`

**Critical User Journeys:**
1. **Happy Path** - New user completes full onboarding successfully
2. **Skip Flow** - User skips optional profile setup
3. **Device Issues** - Camera permission denied, troubleshooting shown
4. **Browser Warning** - Outdated browser detection and upgrade prompt
5. **Demo Meeting** - User creates and completes first demo meeting

**Mock Requirements:**
- Mock camera/microphone permissions using Playwright's `context.grantPermissions()`
- Mock browser capabilities using `page.addInitScript()`
- Mock analytics endpoints to verify event tracking
- Use Playwright's device emulation for mobile testing

#### Success Criteria Testing
All metrics defined in story must be measurable:
- Onboarding completion rate >80% (tracked via analytics)
- Device setup success rate >95% (tracked via analytics)
- Time to first meeting <3 minutes (measured in e2e tests)
- User satisfaction >4.5/5 (feedback survey integration)

**Test Data Setup:**
- Use test user accounts from Story 1.2 auth setup
- Reset onboarding state between test runs
- Use deterministic UUIDs for reproducibility

### Onboarding State Management
**Reference:** `docs/prd.md#risk-mitigation-strategy` and `docs/architecture/user-flows.md#onboarding`

```typescript
interface OnboardingState {
  step: 'welcome' | 'permissions' | 'profile' | 'first-meeting' | 'complete';
  progress: number;
  completedSteps: string[];
  canSkip: boolean;
  timeEstimate: string;
  lastCompletedAt: Date;
}

const OnboardingSteps = [
  {
    id: 'welcome',
    required: true,
    timeEstimate: '30s',
    title: 'Welcome to MeetSolis',
    description: 'Quick introduction to the platform'
  },
  {
    id: 'permissions',
    required: true,
    timeEstimate: '1min',
    title: 'Device Setup',
    description: 'Test your camera and microphone'
  },
  {
    id: 'profile',
    required: false,
    timeEstimate: '2min',
    title: 'Profile Setup',
    description: 'Complete your profile information'
  },
  {
    id: 'first-meeting',
    required: false,
    timeEstimate: '3min',
    title: 'First Meeting',
    description: 'Create and test your first meeting'
  }
];
```

### Progressive Disclosure Pattern
```typescript
interface OnboardingComponent {
  showTooltip: boolean;
  highlightElement: boolean;
  blockInteraction: boolean;
  showProgress: boolean;
  allowSkip: boolean;
}

class OnboardingManager {
  private currentStep: number = 0;
  private totalSteps: number;

  next(): void {
    if (this.canProceed()) {
      this.currentStep++;
      this.updateProgress();
    }
  }

  skip(): void {
    if (this.canSkip()) {
      this.markStepSkipped();
      this.next();
    }
  }

  private canProceed(): boolean {
    return this.currentStep < this.totalSteps;
  }
}
```

### Device Testing Implementation
```typescript
interface DeviceTestResult {
  camera: {
    available: boolean;
    resolution: string;
    frameRate: number;
    error?: string;
  };
  microphone: {
    available: boolean;
    volume: number;
    quality: 'excellent' | 'good' | 'poor';
    error?: string;
  };
  speakers: {
    available: boolean;
    testPassed: boolean;
    error?: string;
  };
}

class DeviceTestingWizard {
  async testDevices(): Promise<DeviceTestResult> {
    const result: DeviceTestResult = {
      camera: await this.testCamera(),
      microphone: await this.testMicrophone(),
      speakers: await this.testSpeakers()
    };

    return result;
  }

  generateTroubleshootingGuide(result: DeviceTestResult): TroubleshootingGuide {
    // Generate specific guidance based on test results
  }
}
```

### Browser Compatibility Detection
```typescript
interface BrowserCapabilities {
  webrtc: boolean;
  mediaDevices: boolean;
  screenShare: boolean;
  notifications: boolean;
  websockets: boolean;
  modernFeatures: boolean;
}

class BrowserCompatibility {
  static detect(): BrowserCapabilities {
    return {
      webrtc: !!window.RTCPeerConnection,
      mediaDevices: !!navigator.mediaDevices,
      screenShare: !!navigator.mediaDevices?.getDisplayMedia,
      notifications: 'Notification' in window,
      websockets: 'WebSocket' in window,
      modernFeatures: this.checkModernFeatures()
    };
  }

  static getUpgradeGuidance(): UpgradeGuidance {
    const browser = this.detectBrowser();
    return this.upgradeGuides[browser];
  }
}
```

### Onboarding Analytics Implementation
```typescript
interface OnboardingMetrics {
  stepCompletionRates: Record<string, number>;
  dropOffPoints: string[];
  timeToValue: number; // Time to first successful meeting
  supportTicketsGenerated: number;
  userSatisfactionScore: number;
  deviceIssuesEncountered: DeviceIssueMetrics;
}

class OnboardingAnalytics {
  trackStepCompletion(step: string, timeSpent: number): void {
    // Track completion rates and timing
  }

  trackDropOff(step: string, reason?: string): void {
    // Identify where users abandon onboarding
  }

  trackSuccessMetrics(userId: string, timeToFirstMeeting: number): void {
    // Measure time to value realization
  }
}
```

### Success Metrics & Monitoring
**Reference:** `docs/prd.md#success-metrics` and `docs/architecture/monitoring.md#user-onboarding-metrics`

- **Onboarding Completion Rate**: Target >80% within 5 minutes
- **Device Setup Success Rate**: Target >95% with troubleshooting
- **Time to First Meeting**: Target <3 minutes from signup
- **User Satisfaction Score**: Target >4.5/5 for onboarding experience
- **Support Ticket Reduction**: Target <5 tickets/day related to onboarding

### User Experience Safeguards
- **Clear Progress Indicators**: Always show where users are in the process
- **Escape Hatches**: Allow users to skip non-essential steps
- **Error Recovery**: Provide clear paths to resolve issues
- **Success Reinforcement**: Celebrate completion of key milestones
- **Contextual Help**: Provide help exactly when and where needed
