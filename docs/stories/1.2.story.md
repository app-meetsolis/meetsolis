## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 1.1 Dev Agent Record]
- Project structure established with proper security foundation
- TypeScript compilation errors need resolution before proceeding
- Service layer architecture ready for security middleware integration
- Test framework configured and ready for security test implementation

### Security Headers Configuration
[Source: docs/architecture/security-and-performance.md]
**Content Security Policy Requirements:**
```typescript
const securityHeaders = {
  'Content-Security-Policy': `
    default-src 'self';
    script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://*.clerk.dev https://*.paddle.com https://*.razorpay.com;
    connect-src 'self' https://*.supabase.co wss://*.supabase.co;
    img-src 'self' data: https:;
    style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
    font-src 'self' data:;
  `,
  'X-XSS-Protection': '1; mode=block',
  'X-Frame-Options': 'DENY',
  'X-Content-Type-Options': 'nosniff',
  'Strict-Transport-Security': 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains',
  'Referrer-Policy': 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin'
};
```

### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
**Edge Runtime Compatible Packages:**
- **next-secure-headers**: For CSP and security headers (Edge Runtime compatible alternative to next-helmet)
- **sanitize-html**: ^2.11.0 for XSS prevention (verified Edge Runtime compatible)
- **@upstash/ratelimit**: Edge-optimized rate limiting with Redis backend
- **@sentry/nextjs**: ^7.93.0 for error tracking and security monitoring

**Note:** Original tech stack specified next-helmet and express-rate-limit, but these are not compatible with Next.js Edge Runtime. Using Edge-compatible alternatives above.

### Input Validation and Sanitization
[Source: docs/architecture/security-and-performance.md]
**Implementation Requirements:**
- Use Zod schemas for all API input validation
- Implement sanitize-html for user-generated content
- SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries (already configured with Supabase)
- XSS prevention through Content Security Policy and input sanitization

### Rate Limiting Configuration
[Source: docs/architecture/security-and-performance.md]
**Edge Runtime Rate Limiting with @upstash/ratelimit:**
- API routes: 100 requests/minute per user
- Authentication: 1000 requests/hour per user
- Anonymous requests: IP-based limiting
- Health checks: Bypass rate limiting
- Implementation: Vercel Edge Middleware with Upstash Redis backend
- Caching: Hot function caching to reduce Redis calls for better performance

### Authentication Security
[Source: docs/architecture/security-and-performance.md]
**Security Requirements:**
- JWT tokens in httpOnly cookies with secure, sameSite attributes
- 30-minute idle timeout with automatic refresh
- Session management handled by Clerk integration

### CORS Policy Configuration
[Source: docs/architecture/security-and-performance.md]
**Allowed Origins:**
- https://meetsolis.com
- https://staging.meetsolis.com
- http://localhost:3000 (development only)

### Performance Considerations
[Source: docs/architecture/security-and-performance.md]
- Security middleware should add < 10ms to request processing
- Rate limiting uses Upstash Redis with edge-optimized caching
- Security headers cached at Vercel Edge level for optimal performance
- @upstash/ratelimit provides hot function caching to minimize Redis calls

## Testing

[Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]

### Security Test Requirements
- **Test Location:** `apps/web/tests/security/`
- **Test Framework:** Jest with @testing-library for component security tests
- **API Security Tests:** Use supertest for rate limiting and header validation
- **E2E Security Tests:** Cypress tests for CSP and XSS prevention
