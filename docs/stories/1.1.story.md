### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Type Sharing**: Define types in packages/shared and import from there
- **API Calls**: Use service layer, never direct HTTP calls
- **Environment Variables**: Access through config objects, never process.env directly
- **Error Handling**: All API routes must use standard error handler
- **Naming Conventions**:
  - Components: PascalCase (UserProfile.tsx)
  - Hooks: camelCase with 'use' (useAuth.ts)
  - API Routes: kebab-case (/api/user-profile)

### Database Schema Context
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md]
Core tables that will be needed: users, meetings, participants, messages, reactions, files, meeting_summaries
- PostgreSQL with UUID primary keys
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- JSONB columns for flexible configurations
- Audit logging and automated cleanup functions

### Security Requirements
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md, architecture/tech-stack.md]
- CSP headers via next-helmet
- Input sanitization with sanitize-html
- Environment variable security
- HTTPS enforcement and HSTS headers
- JWT validation for API routes

### Testing & WebRTC Risk Mitigation

#### Testing Framework Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md + WebRTC Risk Mitigation]
- **Frontend Tests**: Jest + @testing-library/react for components
- **Backend Tests**: Jest + supertest for API routes
- **E2E Tests**: Cypress for full user flows including WebRTC
- **WebRTC Testing**: Mock MediaStream, device simulation, connection testing
- **Test Organization**:
  - `tests/components/` - Component tests
  - `tests/hooks/` - Hook tests
  - `tests/pages/` - Page tests
  - `tests/api/` - API route tests
  - `tests/e2e/` - Cypress E2E tests
  - `tests/webrtc/` - WebRTC-specific tests
  - `tests/mocks/` - Service and device mocks

#### WebRTC Testing Strategy
[Source: Risk Mitigation Strategy]
```typescript
// WebRTC Testing Utilities
interface MockMediaStream {
  getTracks(): MediaStreamTrack[];
  addTrack(track: MediaStreamTrack): void;
  removeTrack(track: MediaStreamTrack): void;
}

// Cross-browser testing matrix
const WEBRTC_TEST_BROWSERS = [
  'chrome', 'firefox', 'safari', 'edge'
];

// Connection testing scenarios
const CONNECTION_SCENARIOS = [
  'direct-connection',
  'firewall-restricted',
  'low-bandwidth',
  'packet-loss',
  'mobile-network'
];
```

#### Required Test Setup
- Install testing dependencies with exact versions from tech stack
- Configure Jest for both frontend and backend testing
- Set up test scripts in package.json
- Create example test files following architecture patterns
- Configure WebRTC mock environment for consistent testing
- Set up cross-browser testing pipeline for WebRTC compatibility
