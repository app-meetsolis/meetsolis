# Security and Performance

### Security Requirements

**Frontend Security:**
- CSP Headers: `default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://*.clerk.dev https://*.paddle.com https://*.razorpay.com; connect-src 'self' https://*.supabase.co wss://*.supabase.co;`
- XSS Prevention: Input sanitization with `sanitize-html`, Content Security Policy
- Secure Storage: JWT tokens in httpOnly cookies, sensitive data in Clerk secure storage

**Backend Security:**
- Input Validation: Zod schemas for all API inputs, SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries
- Rate Limiting: 100 requests/minute per user for API routes, 1000 requests/hour for authentication
- CORS Policy: `https://meetsolis.com, https://staging.meetsolis.com, http://localhost:3000`

**Authentication Security:**
- Token Storage: JWT in httpOnly cookies with secure, sameSite attributes
- Session Management: 30-minute idle timeout, automatic refresh
- Password Policy: Handled by Clerk (8+ characters, complexity requirements)

### Performance Optimization

**Frontend Performance:**
- Bundle Size Target: < 300KB initial bundle, < 1MB total
- Loading Strategy: Lazy loading for video components, code splitting by route
- Caching Strategy: React Query for API data, Service Worker for static assets

**Backend Performance:**
- Response Time Target: < 200ms for API routes, < 500ms for database queries
- Database Optimization: Indexed foreign keys, query optimization, connection pooling
- Caching Strategy: Vercel Edge caching, Supabase built-in caching
