# MeetSolis UI/UX Specification

## Introduction

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for MeetSolis's user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

Based on the comprehensive PRD analysis, MeetSolis is positioned as a **premium Zoom alternative specifically designed for freelancers and small-medium agencies** (2-10 employees) who conduct frequent client video calls. The platform addresses critical pain points: unprofessional call experiences, scope creep, billing inefficiencies, and client trust issues through specialized tools and a single, affordable plan ($12-15/month).

### Change Log

| Date | Version | Description | Author |
|------|---------|-------------|---------|
| 2025-01-20 | 1.0 | Initial UI/UX specification for Epic 1-2 MVP | UX Expert |

## Overall UX Goals & Principles

### Target User Personas

**Primary Persona - The Professional Freelancer:**
- Independent designers, marketers, consultants conducting 5-15 client calls weekly
- Values: Professional credibility, time efficiency, burnout prevention
- Pain Points: Zoom fatigue, scope creep, manual note-taking, technical glitches
- Context: Working from home/co-working spaces, often back-to-back calls

**Secondary Persona - Small Agency Owner:**
- Managing 2-10 team members with multiple client accounts
- Values: Team collaboration, client satisfaction metrics, scalable processes
- Pain Points: Tool complexity, inconsistent client experiences across team
- Context: Hybrid work environments, need for team coordination features

**Tertiary Persona - International Freelancer:**
- Global clients requiring translation and cultural sensitivity
- Values: Clear communication, professional appearance despite location
- Pain Points: Language barriers, timezone coordination, background noise
- Context: Diverse home office setups, varying internet connectivity

### Usability Goals

**Critical Success Metrics:**
- **Onboarding Efficiency:** New users complete first successful call within 5 minutes
- **Call Setup Speed:** 20% reduction in pre-call preparation time vs. competitors
- **Professional Credibility:** Virtual backgrounds and quality checks boost client confidence
- **Feature Adoption:** 80% of users actively use 3+ core features within first week
- **Retention:** <10% monthly churn through burnout prevention and wellness features

### Design Principles

1. **Minimalism-First, Premium Feel** - Reduce cognitive load while enhancing professional credibility through sparse elegance inspired by ChatGPT and Notion
2. **One-Click Professionalism** - Pre-call quality checks, background optimization, and teleprompter setup accessible with single interactions
3. **Contextual Tool Access** - Whiteboard, file sharing, and timers appear contextually during calls without cluttering the interface
4. **Gentle Guidance** - Non-intrusive notifications and fatigue alerts that suggest rather than demand attention
5. **Adaptive Personalization** - Interface elements adjust based on user role (freelancer vs. agency) and frequently used features

- **Meetings:** Filter tabs (Upcoming, Past, Recordings, Files)
- **In-Call:** Floating toolbar with essential controls (mute, video, share, whiteboard, end)

**Breadcrumb Strategy:** Minimal breadcrumbs for deep navigation paths only:
- Dashboard > Meeting History > [Meeting Name] > Recording
- Settings > Integrations > Google Calendar Setup

## User Flows

### Epic 1: User Onboarding & Authentication Flow

**User Goal:** Successfully sign up, authenticate, and complete initial setup to prepare for first client call

**Entry Points:** Landing page CTA, referral links, organic search

**Success Criteria:** User completes profile setup and feels confident to schedule their first meeting within 5 minutes

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling:
- OAuth failure: Graceful fallback to email signup with clear error messaging
- Incomplete profile: Save progress and allow return with reminder email
- Integration failures: Defer calendar/tool connections to post-onboarding
- Browser compatibility: Progressive enhancement with WebRTC feature detection
- Network interruption: Offline-capable PWA with sync on reconnection

**Notes:** Onboarding prioritizes empathy validation over feature tours, directly addressing the PRD's focus on freelancer pain points (scope creep, burnout, unprofessional experiences). The flow is designed to be completable in under 5 minutes while collecting personalization data for dashboard customization.

### Epic 2: Core Video Call Flow

**User Goal:** Start, conduct, and conclude a professional client video call with enhanced productivity tools

**Entry Points:** Dashboard quick action, scheduled meeting notification, direct meeting URL

```

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling:

- Network degradation: Quality auto-adjustment with user notification
- Recording failures: Local backup option with cloud sync retry
- AI processing delays: Graceful loading states with manual override options
- Browser crashes: Auto-rejoin functionality with meeting state preservation

**Notes:** This flow emphasizes reliability and professional experience over feature complexity. The quality check and auto-optimization address the PRD's <1% failure rate requirement, while AI monitoring supports the wellness/burnout prevention goals through fatigue detection.

### Epic 1-2 Integration: Dashboard to Meeting Flow

**User Goal:** Seamlessly transition from dashboard overview to active client meeting

**Entry Points:** Dashboard call cards, calendar notifications, quick start button

**Success Criteria:** <30 seconds from dashboard click to meeting start, all preparation tools accessible

    M -->|Ready| N[Enter Meeting]
    M -->|Need Changes| I

    N --> O[In-Call Interface]
    O --> P[Return to Dashboard]
```

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling:
- Missing meeting details: Smart defaults with in-meeting editing capability
- Client joining early: Automatic waiting room with host notification
- Multiple device access: Session management with primary device priority
- Agenda import failures: Manual entry with AI assistance for structure
- Timer conflicts: Intelligent suggestions based on meeting history

## Component Library / Design System

### Design System Approach
**Strategy:** Build custom MeetSolis Design System using Shadcn UI as foundation, extended with specialized video conferencing and freelancer productivity components. This approach leverages battle-tested accessibility and interaction patterns while allowing customization for the premium, minimalist brand positioning.

### Core Components

### Button Component

**Purpose:** Primary interaction element with clear hierarchy supporting professional, conversion-focused actions

**Variants:**
- **Primary:** Deep navy (#001F3F) background for main CTAs (Start Call, Join Meeting)
- **Secondary:** Navy outline with white background for secondary actions (Schedule, Settings)
- **Tertiary:** Text-only with teal hover for low-priority actions (Cancel, Learn More)
- **Destructive:** Muted red for dangerous actions (End Call, Delete)
- **Ghost:** Transparent for toolbar buttons (Mute, Video Toggle)

**States:**
- **Default:** Base styling with subtle shadow for depth
- **Hover:** Scale 1.02 with color transition (300ms ease)
- **Active:** Pressed state with inset shadow
- **Disabled:** 40% opacity with cursor not-allowed
- **Loading:** Spinner animation with disabled interaction

**Usage Guidelines:** Primary buttons limited to 1-2 per screen to maintain focus. Icon + text for complex actions, icon-only for space-constrained contexts (floating toolbar). Minimum 48px touch target for mobile accessibility.

### VideoTile Component

**Purpose:** Specialized component for participant video display with professional overlay information

**Variants:**
- **Speaker:** Large format for active speaker with prominence

- **Active:** Currently in session with live indicators
- **Starting Soon:** Countdown timer with prominent join button
- **Overdue:** Yellow border with gentle alert styling
- **Archived:** Reduced opacity with restore option

**Usage Guidelines:** Cards maintain consistent padding (24px) and corner radius (8px). Time information always prominent with relative formatting ("in 15 minutes", "2 days ago"). One primary action per card to prevent decision paralysis.

## Animation & Micro-interactions

### Motion Principles

**Performance-First Animation Philosophy:** All animations serve functional purposes while maintaining 60fps performance across devices. Inspired by Material Design's motion principles but adapted for professional video conferencing contexts where distraction must be minimized.

### Key Animations

**Interface Transitions:**
- **Page navigation:** Slide transition between main sections (Duration: 300ms, Easing: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 1))
- **Modal appearance:** Scale and fade-in from center (Duration: 200ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Sidebar collapse:** Width transition with content fade (Duration: 250ms, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **Card hover states:** Subtle lift with shadow increase (Duration: 150ms, Easing: ease-out)

**Video Interface Micro-interactions:**
- **Control panel auto-hide:** Fade out after 3s inactivity (Duration: 500ms, Easing: ease-in)
- **Participant join/leave:** Smooth grid reflow with crossfade (Duration: 400ms, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **Mute/unmute feedback:** Icon pulse with color change (Duration: 200ms, Easing: bounce)
- **Connection quality indicator:** Pulsing dots with color progression (Duration: 1000ms, Easing: ease-in-out, infinite)

**Status and Feedback Animations:**
- **Button press confirmation:** Brief scale down and back (Duration: 100ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Success notifications:** Slide in from top with gentle bounce (Duration: 300ms, Easing: cubic-bezier(0.68, -0.55, 0.265, 1.55))
- **Loading states:** Skeleton screens with shimmer effect (Duration: 1500ms, Easing: linear, infinite)
- **AI processing indicator:** Typing dots animation with brand colors (Duration: 600ms, Easing: ease-in-out, infinite)

## Performance Considerations

### Performance Goals

- **Page Load:** Initial dashboard load within 3 seconds on standard broadband (5Mbps+) as specified in PRD NFR5
- **Interaction Response:** All UI interactions respond within 100ms, video controls within 50ms for professional feel
- **Animation FPS:** Maintain 60fps for all animations, with graceful degradation to 30fps on lower-end devices

### Design Strategies

**Critical Performance Design Decisions:**

**Lazy Loading Architecture:**
- **Video components:** WebRTC libraries loaded only when joining/starting calls
- **Advanced features:** AI tools, whiteboard, and analytics loaded on-demand
- **Image optimization:** Next.js Image component with WebP format, responsive sizing
- **Code splitting:** Route-based splitting with feature-based chunks for tools

**Progressive Enhancement Strategy:**
- **Core functionality first:** Basic video calling works without JavaScript enhancements
- **Enhanced features:** AI summaries, real-time collaboration loaded progressively
- **Offline capability:** Critical dashboard data cached for offline viewing
- **Network adaptation:** Feature availability adapts to connection quality

**Memory Management:**
- **Video stream cleanup:** Automatic cleanup of unused video streams after 30 seconds
- **Component unmounting:** Proper cleanup of WebRTC connections and event listeners
- **Large dataset virtualization:** Meeting history and analytics use virtual scrolling
- **Image caching:** Intelligent cache management for user avatars and backgrounds
