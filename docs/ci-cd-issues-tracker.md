# CI/CD Issues Tracker

This document tracks known CI/CD issues that need resolution to maintain healthy development workflow.

## Current Issues

### Issue #1: Unit Tests Directory Structure Mismatch
**Status:** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Quick Fix Applied
**Date Identified:** 2025-09-29
**Date Resolved:** 2025-10-01
**Identified By:** Quinn (Test Architect)
**Resolved By:** Claude Code
**Story Context:** Post Story 1.2 completion ‚Üí Fixed after Story 1.3

#### Problem Description
Jest unit test runner fails because it searches for tests in `tests/unit/` directory but no unit tests exist there. Current test structure has comprehensive security tests in `tests/security/` which are all passing (47 tests), but the CI pipeline specifically runs unit tests with pattern `tests/unit`.

#### Impact Assessment
- **Functional Impact:** ‚ùå None - All security functionality is tested and working
- **CI/CD Impact:** üö® **HIGH** - All CI runs fail on unit test step
- **Development Impact:** üü° **MEDIUM** - Developers see red CI status despite working code
- **Deployment Impact:** üü° **MEDIUM** - May block automated deployments if configured

#### Current Test Organization
```
apps/web/tests/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ security/        # 4 comprehensive security tests (‚úÖ PASSING)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ integration/     # 1 service connectivity test (‚úÖ PASSING)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ webrtc/         # 1 WebRTC connection test (‚úÖ PASSING)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ unit/           # ‚ùå EMPTY - Causing Jest failure
```

#### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Test Classification Mismatch:** Security tests were implemented as comprehensive integration-style tests rather than isolated unit tests
2. **Directory Structure:** Tests were organized by feature (security) rather than by type (unit/integration/e2e)
3. **CI Configuration:** CI pipeline expects traditional test-type organization

#### Solution Options

**Option A: Quick Fix (Recommended for immediate CI health)**
```json
// In apps/web/package.json
"test:unit": "jest --testPathPattern=tests/unit --passWithNoTests"
```
- **Pros:** Immediate CI fix, no code changes needed
- **Cons:** Doesn't address underlying organization issue

**Option B: Test Reorganization (Comprehensive solution)**
1. Create proper unit tests for individual functions/components
2. Move current security tests to `tests/integration/security/`
3. Reorganize all tests by type rather than feature
- **Pros:** Clean test architecture, proper separation of concerns
- **Cons:** Requires significant reorganization effort

**Option C: Hybrid Approach (Balanced solution)**
1. Apply quick fix for immediate CI health
2. Gradually add proper unit tests as new components are developed
3. Maintain current security tests in place (they're comprehensive and valuable)

#### **Recommended Timeline: After Story 1.3 Completion**

**Why After Story 1.3:**
- Story 1.3 likely involves new component development
- New components will need unit tests anyway
- Allows for natural test structure evolution
- Doesn't interrupt current development momentum
- Security foundation is solid and well-tested

**When NOT to Fix:**
- ‚ùå **During Story 1.3 Development** - Would interrupt feature development
- ‚ùå **Before Story 1.3** - Unnecessary delay when security is already well-tested

**Suggested Implementation Schedule:**
1. **Immediate (Optional):** Apply Option A quick fix for green CI
2. **Post Story 1.3:** Implement Option C hybrid approach
3. **Story 1.4+:** All new components include proper unit tests from start

#### Risk Assessment
- **Probability of Impact:** Low (security is thoroughly tested)
- **Severity if Ignored:** Medium (CI health degradation)
- **Business Risk:** Low (functionality is proven working)

#### Resolution Tracking
- [x] Decision made on solution approach (Option C - Hybrid Approach)
- [x] Quick fix applied (`--passWithNoTests` flag added to `test:unit` script)
- [x] Test organization strategy: Feature-based organization maintained
- [x] CI pipeline now passes with exit code 0
- [ ] Future: New components should include unit tests in feature directories

#### Resolution Details
**Solution Applied:** Option A Quick Fix (as part of Option C Hybrid Approach)
- Modified `apps/web/package.json` test:unit script
- Added `--passWithNoTests` flag to prevent CI failure when `tests/unit/` is empty
- Current tests remain organized by feature area (auth, api, hooks, security)
- **Result:** CI now passes ‚úÖ

**Test Organization Strategy Moving Forward:**
- Feature-based organization: `tests/{feature}/` (e.g., `tests/auth/`, `tests/api/`)
- All Story 1.3 tests follow this pattern (15 comprehensive test files)
- Future stories will continue this approach
- Unit tests are embedded within feature directories

## Issue Resolution Guidelines

### Priority Levels
- üî¥ **CRITICAL:** Blocks production deployments - Fix immediately
- üü° **MEDIUM:** Impacts development workflow - Fix in next maintenance window
- üü¢ **LOW:** Nice to have improvements - Address when convenient

### When to Fix Issues
- **During Active Development:** Only critical issues that block progress
- **Between Stories:** Medium priority organizational issues
- **During Maintenance Cycles:** All remaining low priority improvements

### Documentation Requirements
All CI/CD issues must include:
1. Clear problem description with error logs
2. Impact assessment on development workflow
3. Multiple solution options with pros/cons
4. Recommended timeline based on development priorities
5. Risk assessment for delayed resolution
