# User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
MeetSolis embodies a "minimalism-first, premium feel" philosophy that reduces cognitive load while enhancing professional credibility. The interface serves as an extension of the freelancer's mindâ€”simple, powerful, and burnout-proof. Drawing inspiration from ChatGPT's sparse elegance and Notion's customizable blocks, the experience prioritizes functional beauty over decorative elements. Every interaction should feel intentional and efficient, supporting the user's focus on client relationships rather than tool complexity.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **One-Click Professionalism**: Pre-call quality checks, background optimization, and teleprompter setup accessible with single interactions
- **Contextual Tool Access**: Whiteboard, file sharing, and timers appear contextually during calls without cluttering the interface
- **Gentle Guidance**: Non-intrusive notifications and fatigue alerts that suggest rather than demand attention
- **Adaptive Personalization**: Interface elements adjust based on user role (freelancer vs. agency) and frequently used features
- **Conversational AI Integration**: Natural language inputs for agenda creation and meeting analytics ("Show my client conversion trends")

### Core Screens and Views
- **Dashboard Hub**: Card-based layout featuring upcoming calls, recent recordings, and personalized performance insights
- **Pre-Call Preparation**: Streamlined setup screen with timer configuration, agenda review, and quality testing
- **In-Call Interface**: Full-screen video focus with collapsible side panels for chat, whiteboard, and tools
- **Post-Call Summary**: AI-generated action items, meeting analytics, and async video sharing options
- **Performance Analytics**: Visual dashboard showing meeting trends, client engagement patterns, and wellness indicators
- **Settings & Integrations**: Clean configuration for calendar sync, billing tools, and personal branding elements

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
Full compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards including keyboard navigation, screen reader support, high contrast ratios (4.5:1 minimum), and scalable fonts. Color-blind friendly design uses patterns and shapes alongside color coding. All interactive elements meet 48px minimum touch targets for mobile accessibility.

### Branding
Professional, trustworthy aesthetic that reinforces user credibility during client calls. Deep navy (#001F3F) primary color conveys reliability and depth, while soft teal (#00A0B0) accents provide warmth without distraction. Clean typography (Inter/system fonts) ensures cross-platform consistency. Optional custom branding upload allows users to incorporate personal logos and color preferences for client-facing elements.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Optimized for desktop-first usage (primary use case) with seamless mobile/tablet adaptation. Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities enable offline functionality and app-like experience across all platforms. Responsive breakpoints ensure feature parity while adapting interface density for different screen sizes.
