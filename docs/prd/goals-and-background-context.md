### Background Context
MeetSolis serves as a Zoom alternative specifically designed for freelancers and small-to-medium agency owners (2-10 employees) who conduct frequent client video calls. This market includes 40M+ U.S. freelancers plus thousands of small agencies, all seeking efficient client communication tools. Current solutions create friction: Zoom's enterprise-focused bloat and complex pricing, Google Meet's lack of client-specific features, and Teams' complexity. Both freelancers and agency owners face similar pain pointsâ€”unprofessional call experiences, scope creep, billing inefficiencies, and client trust issues. MeetSolis addresses these through a single, affordable plan ($12-15/month) that eliminates feature gatekeeping while providing specialized tools for client-facing professionals.
